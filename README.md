# Example data

This branch contains example chromatograms from Knoevenagel condensation ([Haas et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.2c01042)). You can download this data using:

```
git clone https://github.com/bayer-group/MOCCA-frontend/tree/example-data
```

The data contains:
- calibration standards
    - blank gradient
    - benzaldehyde, 994.7 uM
    - 4-anisaldehyde, 1316.2 uM
    - N,N-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, 967.6 uM
- reaction samples
    - blank gradient
    - 10 samples taken roughly every 18:12 (min:sec), accurate times are in the file names
    - the reaction start was at 15:53:30 (first sample was taken after 18:08 min:sec)
